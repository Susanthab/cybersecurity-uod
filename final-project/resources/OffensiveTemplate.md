### Exploitation

The Red Team was able to penetrate `Target 1` and retrieve the following confidential data:
- Target 1
  - `flag1.txt`: flag1{b9bbcb33ellb80be759c4e844862482d}
    ![flag-1](/final-project/images/flag1.png)
    - **Exploit Used**
    Manual brute force attack to guess Michael's password. User password was weak and obvious. 
      - ssh michael@192.168.1.110
      - pw: michael (weak password)
      - cat /var/www/html/service.html (see above screenshot)
  - `flag2.txt`: flag2{fc3fd58dcdad9ab23faca6e9a3e581c}
     ![flag-2](/final-project/images/flag2.png)
    - **Exploit Used**
    It was the same exploit used to get the flag1. 
      - ssh michael@192.168.1.110
      - pw: michael (weak password)
      - cat /var/www/flag2.txt
